# Expository project of Refinements of the Groebner Basis Criteria and Improvements of Buchbergerâ€™s Algorithm

This is a repository for hosting an expository paper as well as class presentation I gave, in which I explored simple refinements and improvements that can be made to the standard [Buchberger algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchberger%27s_algorithm) and [Groebner basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis) criteria usually presented in introductory computational [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry) courses. Note that these refinements are well-known, and this class project was simply a way for the professor to gauge how well a graduate student, like myself at the time, could independtly research and present material.
