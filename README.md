# Expository project of refinements of the Groebner basis criteria and improvements of Buchbergerâ€™s algorithm

This is a repository for hosting an expository paper as well as class presentation I gave for my Graduate Computational Algebraic Geometry class, Math 8500.

The project write-up may be found above by clicking on 8500ProjectWriteUp.pdf, or clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/8500BuchbergerProject/blob/main/8500ProjectWriteUp.pdf). The corresponding .tex files for the write-up are found in the Paper folder. The project presentation I gave for the class may be found above by clicking on 8500ProjectPresentation.pdf, or clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/8500BuchbergerProject/blob/main/8500ProjectPresentation.pdf). The corresponding .tex files for the presentation may be found in the ProjectPresentation folder. 

In the project, I explored simple refinements and improvements that can be made to the standard [Buchberger algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchberger%27s_algorithm) and [Groebner basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis) criteria usually presented in introductory computational [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry) courses. Note that these refinements are well-known, and this class project was simply a way for the professor to gauge how well a graduate student, like myself at the time, could independently research and present material.
